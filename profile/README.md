At CoderSports we have a special GitHub enterprise account which has all of the Co-Op students in it. It also already has all of the previous repositories from repl.it. We will be using GitHub to store all of our code, and to collaborate with each other. We will only use private repositories, so the public will not be able to see our code.<br>
